# Instagram-Automatic-Commenter
Objective-C bot to post comments on latest posts for specified profiles

#Disclaimer
Please note that Instagram strongly advises people not to use Private API endpoint for building 3rd party applications.
This has been made for educational purposes, i highly recommend to do not use it. Instagram strictly forbids usage of their private api.

#Usage
To use you need to provide login,password and instagram secret key - can be easily googled but as it's for educational purposes i recommend to reverse it from their binaries, it's quite easy. 
Before compiling make sure to specify array of profile ids to post comment on.
